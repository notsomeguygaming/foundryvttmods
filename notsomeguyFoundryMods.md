        - D lib-df-buttons

        - You can have the tool `grow` the rectangle out from a center point by `holding the Ctrl` key while placing the `ellipse` tool. Useful if you know where the center of a room is and just want to grow the wall tool out from there.

         - `right click` bottom list player name for `goto` option, bit buggy and doesn't always show up
- <span style="background:navy">![_____](tags/navy.png)</span> https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-scene-navigation
    -v10-12

    ```

        -v10-12
        - D `wall-height`
        - https://wiki.theripper93.com/levels
        - `basic tutorial` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELlweNunn4g
        - `updated tutorial` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmGxEkmJblE
        - Create maps with multiple vertical levels
        - uses floor `elevations`    0-9    10-19   20-29   etc
        - floor `roof` uses `hide(br mode)`, `fade(occlusion)`
        - `highest roof` uses `any except 'none' but usually 'show'(br mode)`, `fade(occlusion)`
        - with `global illumination` off, take the highest floor tile height(top) and set the roof to the same height (bottom)
            - example 2 story with roof
                - level 1 tile `0-9`
                - level 2 tile `10-19`
                - level 3 roof `19-infinite` with roof tile `is roof` on
            - if that doesn't work for whatever reason, may need `global illumination` on if the roof tiles are still black and not showing
                - if `betterroofs` is not enabled, that can also cause the black tiles
        - make a layer from 0 to 99 and `click on it` if you can't see some items in your current scene, as sometimes tokens will be placed on different levels even if the levels popup isn't on
        - used with `baileywiki`
        - <span style="background:ivory">![_____](tags/ivory.png)</span>https://foundryvtt.com/packages/betterroofs
            -v10-12
            - enhances Foundry's overhead tile vision functionality
            - https://wiki.theripper93.com/free/betterroofs
            - If you are using `Levels`, the Top of the tile needs to be set to `Infinity` for the tile to count as a roof, as well as `is a roof` checked
            - adds `occlusionID` which is useful if you want to hide more than one roof when a token is on that floor
            - used with `baileywiki` 
        - <span style="background:ivory">![_____](tags/ivory.png)</span>https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wall-height
            -v10-12
                - allows setting vertical heights to walls
                - allows tokens to look over or under walls and to move over or under them according to relative height
                - https://wiki.theripper93.com/free/wall-height
                - setting `token height` in token properties to anything other than `0` will override automatic calculation, making `computed token height` equal to the input value
                    - `token height` set to 0 sets `base height` to 5
                    - `computed token height` is `(base height * token scale) + elevation`
                    - `computed token height` must be higher than wall height to see over, not equal
                        - wall `5`, token height `5` can't see
                        - wall `5`, token height `5`, elevation `1` can see
                        - wall `5`, token height `5`, scale `1.1` can see
                        - wall `5`, token height `6` can see
                        - wall `10`, token height `5`, scale `2` can see other side but not tokens near wall
                        - wall `10`, token height `5`, scale `2.16` can see tokens on other side next to the wall
                - used with `baileywiki`
    - <span style="background:gold">![_____](tags/gold.png)</span>https://foundryvtt.com/packages/stairways

    - allows you to control lighting and vision locally within the shape of a drawing. It gives you the ability to control the maximum vision and detection ranges within the area of drawings, lights, templates, and scenes
    - might be replaced by `vision-5e`?
    - adds `priority and vision limitation` to light properties
    - has some interesting options in `scene` for limiting global vision

        - <span style="background:ivory">![_____](tags/ivory.png)</span>https://foundryvtt.com/packages/stealthy
            -v10-12
            - filters out any objects with the 'Hidden' condition if the viewing Perception value fails to beat the object's Stealth value
            - Rolling `stealth` checks applies the `hidden` condition and allows editing the `stealth` field on `right click` by the DM
            - Rolling `perception` checks applies the `spot` condition and allows editing the `perception` field on `right click` by the DM
            - `set` on `automatic hidden door detection`, enables `regular` doors to have a stealth value which checks against `passive` perception
            - `check manually added hidden values with passive perception`
            - creating a separate token that has the new `hidden` active effect and adding it to every token, as well as adding the `spot` effect to all player tokens is probably your best option with this to account for passive perception since there is no option to always have the inputboxes on the tokens otherwise

        - A: Most likely, your created a permanently playing special effect by dragging a special effect onto the canvas, which is just a regular Tile and not managed by FXMaster. To remove it, go to the Tile Controls and remove the Tile there.

    - <span style="background:navy">![_____](tags/navy.png)</span> https://foundryvtt.com/packages/df-settings-clarity
        -v10-11
        - adds a tag to the start of each module settings’ name that indicates if it is a world (GM Only) or a client (Per User) setting
    - <span style="background:gold">![_____](tags/gold.png)</span>https://foundryvtt.com/packages/force-client-settings
        -v10-12
        ```
        This module adds a lock icons next to the client settings in the settings configuration app. Clicking these icons changes the behavior of the settings:

        "Unlocked" icons mean that the settings are free to be changed by the individual clients.
        "Locked" icons mean that the settings will be forced to those set by the GM.
        "Half-locked" icons mean that the settings will be defaulted to those set by the GM, however any client may optionally "unlock" these settings and adjust them if necessary.

        This allows the GM to either force chosen critical settings to ensure they will not be altered, or "soft-force" other settings that the GM finds helpful to be set to new defaults, but still let the players alter them if they choose to.
        The GM may also choose to either leave the forced settings visible, or hide all of them away from the clients, in order to reduce clutter, via a global setting.

        Forcing certain settings may result in unpredictable behavior, proceed on your own risk. This is unlikely to cause problems for the GM, so they may unlock the problematic settings at any time, however in a tiny chance that the GM would somehow be locked-out from the settings menu, the following might help:

        Launch the game as the GM and open the developer's tools (F12), go to console and type:

        game.settings.set("force-client-settings", "forced", {})

        This will unlock all settings for all clients.

        - Module Management+ improves upon foundry's vtt Manage Module and Configure Settings windows by adding additional features and functionalities to both managing modules and their settings.
        - good for checking dependencies and mod compatibility
        - `best used in a separate world for mod testing, disabled for normal play`

        - `doesn't seem to work fully when changing another user's settings`
        - `this does allow export and import of user settings kind of`
        - best use case is to manually copy the settings in notepad from a user with good settings to the other users but it's very unreliable especially with sync
        - absolute best case would be if the server saved the settings for modules per login user instead of having to use something like this
- <span style="background:navy">![_____](tags/navy.png)</span> https://foundryvtt.com/packages/My-Shared-Compendia

    Preventing Module Update

    Option 1 (easier): Locking your module:
        Go to the Add-on Modules tab within the Foundry VTT Configuration and Setup page.
        Find this module (My Shared Compendia) in the list, and click the padlock icon. 
    Option 2: Updating your module.json file:

    Go to the Module's installation folder within foundry (~/Data/modules/My Shared Compendia) and update the module.json file.
    Remove lines 68-69 (download and manifest) and save the file.
    Restart Foundry to reload the module.
